This workflow manages Terraform deployments for the dev, int, art, and pre environments. Each environment has its own set of Terraform files and does not share code, which is ideal when configurations vary across environments. Each environment also uses a dedicated GitHub Environment to store workload identity credentials and secrets for Terraform state file configuration and authentication. As currently written, the workflow supports only one Terraform state file per environment.
